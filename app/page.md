# Home Page Documentation

This is the main landing page of the blog website. It serves as the entry point and showcases the most important content to visitors.

## Components

- **HeroSection**: A welcoming section at the top of the page that introduces the blog and its purpose
- **FeaturedPosts**: A section displaying pinned or important blog posts (maximum of 3)
- **RecentPosts**: A section showing the most recent blog posts (maximum of 6)
- **NewsletterSection**: A call-to-action for visitors to sign up for the blog's newsletter

## Data Fetching

The page fetches post data using the `getPosts` function from the posts library. It then:
1. Filters posts to find featured ones for the FeaturedPosts section
2. Takes the most recent posts for the RecentPosts section

## Design Considerations

- The page uses a clean, spacious layout with consistent vertical spacing
- Content is organized in a hierarchy, with the most important elements (hero and featured posts) at the top
- Each section has a clear heading for easy navigation
- Components are modular and can be easily rearranged or replaced
